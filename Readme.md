# Goal
This project shows the precision of diffrent predictor types


# Add-ons
- Scala for showing the precision as a green bar throughout runtime
- Global Predictor (change bit length of Global history register)
- Compare with graph
- compare all -> run them at once -> asyncron
- maybye replace in state: complete and correct for a table which stores which jumps where correct
